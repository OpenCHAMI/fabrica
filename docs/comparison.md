# Go Framework Comparison: Finding the Right Tool for Your Project

This document provides an honest, balanced comparison of Go frameworks that generate code or provide comprehensive API development features. For simple routing frameworks (Chi, Gin, Fiber, Echo), see their respective documentation—they're excellent but serve a different purpose than the frameworks compared here.

## 📊 Framework Categories

These frameworks go beyond simple routing to provide higher-level abstractions:

### 1. **Code Generation Frameworks**
Generate significant portions of your codebase from specifications or definitions.
- **Goa** - Design-first with DSL, generates full stack from design
- **Fabrica** - Resource-centric, template-based generation
- **Buffalo** - Rails-like full-stack framework with scaffolding

### 2. **OpenAPI-First Frameworks**
Prioritize comprehensive OpenAPI documentation and schema-driven development.
- **Huma** - Schema-first with comprehensive OpenAPI 3.1 and advanced features
- **Go-Fuego** - Code-first with automatic OpenAPI 3.0 generation
- **Ogen** - Generate server/client from existing OpenAPI specs

### 3. **Full-Stack MVC Frameworks**
Complete frameworks with ORM, templating, and batteries included.
- **Beego** - Enterprise-focused MVC with comprehensive tooling
- **Buffalo** - Rails-like rapid development framework
- **Revel** - Full-stack with hot reload

## 📝 Final Thoughts

**There is no "best" framework** - only the best framework for your specific needs.

### Choose based on:

1. **Project requirements** (features, OpenAPI version, transport protocols)
2. **Team experience** (Rails → Buffalo, Kubernetes → Fabrica, DSL comfort → Goa)
3. **Domain fit** (inventory → Fabrica, general API → Huma/Go-Fuego, enterprise → Beego)
4. **Complexity tolerance** (simple → Go-Fuego, complex → Goa/Fabrica)
5. **Long-term maintenance** (community size, update frequency, stability)

### Remember:

- **Huma**: Production-proven, most complete OpenAPI 3.1, excellent for enterprise APIs
- **Go-Fuego**: Modern and simple, great for new projects with OpenAPI needs
- **Goa**: Powerful design-first, best for multi-protocol microservices
- **Fabrica**: Specialized for inventory/assets, excellent for that specific domain
- **Buffalo/Beego**: Full-stack frameworks, good for traditional web apps
- **Ogen**: Best when you already have OpenAPI specs

### Don't overthink it:

- **For most REST APIs**: Start with **Huma** or **Go-Fuego**
- **Need simple routing only**: Use **Chi** or **Gin** (different category)
- **Building inventory system**: Consider **Fabrica**
- **Need HTTP + gRPC**: Use **Goa**
- **Full-stack web app**: Use **Buffalo**

All frameworks mentioned here are production-ready. Pick one that fits your needs and build something great! 🚀
